# Classical Gas
 A package that simulates a classical gas and calculates the basic physical variables. 
 
 We simulate tha gas through the 'points' class, which defines all the particles in ths gas. There are a few parameters you can play with, such as the number of particles, initial max velocity, mass and gravity. Some physical variables are calculated: temperature, total linear momentum and total energy (kinetic plus potential). It is fun that with g>0, we see that energy and momentum are not conserved, because there is an external force on the system, though this does not increase the temperature nor the time-average quantities. 
 
 The following shows the animation (I have yet to automatic generate the .gif):
